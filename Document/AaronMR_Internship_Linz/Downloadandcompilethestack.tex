\chapter{Download and compile the stack}

In this project we are created a Stack to ROS (Robot Operating System). This stack contain all the code, drivers and nodes developed in the peoject.
The code is hosted in github (http://www.github.com) in the next url: 
\begin{verbatim}
    https://github.com/AaronMR/JKU_Robotic_Stack
\end{verbatim}

To download all the code from the repositories, we can do it with the next lines:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd
    cd dev
    git clone git://github.com/AaronMR/JKU_Robotic_Stack.git
\end{verbatim}


now is necessary update your ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH environment variable

\begin{verbatim}
    export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/dev/JKU_Robotic_Stack:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
\end{verbatim}

Now we need compile all the nodes

\begin{verbatim}
    rosmake R1_Odom
    rosmake R1_teleop_joy
    rosmake R1_teleop_key
    rosmake Laser_PLS200
\end{verbatim}
