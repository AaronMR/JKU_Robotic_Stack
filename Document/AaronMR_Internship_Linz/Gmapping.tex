\begin{verbatim}
 Package Summary

This package contains GMapping, from OpenSlam, and a ROS wrapper. The gmapping package provides laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), as a ROS node called slam_gmapping. Using slam_gmapping, you can create a 2-D occupancy grid map (like a building floorplan) from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot. This package uses r39 from GMapping SVN repsitory at openslam.org, with minor patches applied to support newer versions of GCC and OSX.

External Documentation

This is mostly a third party package; the underlying GMapping library is externally documented. Look there for details on many of the parameters listed below.

Hardware Requirements

To use slam_gmapping, you need a mobile robot that provides odometry data and is equipped with a horizontally-mounted, fixed, laser range-finder. The slam_gmapping node will attempt to transform each incoming scan into the odom (odometry) tf frame. See the "Required tf transforms" for more on required transforms.

Example

To make a map from a robot with a laser publishing scans on the base_scan topic:

rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan

Nodes

slam_gmapping
The slam_gmapping node takes in sensor_msgs/LaserScan messages and builds a map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid). The map can be retrieved via a ROS topic or service.
Subscribed Topics
tf (tf/tfMessage)

    * Transforms necessary to relate frames for laser, base, and odometry (see below) 

scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan)

    * Laser scans to create the map from 

Published Topics
map_metadata (nav_msgs/MapMetaData)

    * Get the map data from this topic, which is latched, and updated periodically. 

map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid)

    * Get the map data from this topic, which is latched, and updated periodically 

~entropy (std_msgs/Float64)

    * Estimate of the entropy of the distribution over the robot's pose (a higher value indicates greater uncertainty). New in 1.1.0. 

Services
dynamic_map (nav_msgs/GetMap)

    * Call this service to get the map data 

Parameters
~inverted_laser (string, default: "false")

    * (REMOVED in 1.1.1; transform data is used instead) Is the laser right side up (scans are ordered CCW), or upside down (scans are ordered CW)? 

~throttle_scans (int, default: 1)

    * Process 1 out of every this many scans (set it to a higher number to skip more scans) 

~base_frame (string, default: "base_link")

    * The frame attached to the mobile base. 

~map_frame (string, default: "map")

    * The frame attached to the map. 

~odom_frame (string, default: "odom")

    * The frame attached to the odometry system. 

~map_update_interval (float, default: 5.0)

    * How long (in seconds) between updates to the map. Lowering this number updates the occupancy grid more often, at the expense of greater computational load. 

~maxUrange (float, default: 80.0)

    * The maximum usable range of the laser. A beam is cropped to this value. 

~sigma (float, default: 0.05)

    * The sigma used by the greedy endpoint matching 

~kernelSize (int, default: 1)

    * The kernel in which to look for a correspondence 

~lstep (float, default: 0.05)

    * The optimization step in translation 

~astep (float, default: 0.05)

    * The optimization step in rotation 

~iterations (int, default: 5)

    * The number of iterations of the scanmatcher 

~lsigma (float, default: 0.075)

    * The sigma of a beam used for likelihood computation 

~ogain (float, default: 3.0)

    * Gain to be used while evaluating the likelihood, for smoothing the resampling effects 

~lskip (int, default: 0)

    * Number of beams to skip in each scan. 

~srr (float, default: 0.1)

    * Odometry error in translation as a function of translation (rho/rho) 

~srt (float, default: 0.2)

    * Odometry error in translation as a function of rotation (rho/theta) 

~str (float, default: 0.1)

    * Odometry error in rotation as a function of translation (theta/rho) 

~stt (float, default: 0.2)

    * Odometry error in rotation as a function of rotation (theta/theta) 

~linearUpdate (float, default: 1.0)

    * Process a scan each time the robot translates this far 

~angularUpdate (float, default: 0.5)

    * Process a scan each time the robot rotates this far 

~temporalUpdate (float, default: -1.0)

    * Process a scan if the last scan proccessed is older than the update time in seconds. A value less than zero will turn time based updates off. 

~resampleThreshold (float, default: 0.5)

    * The neff based resampling threshold (?) 

~particles (int, default: 30)

    * Number of particles in the filter 

~xmin (float, default: -100.0)

    * Initial map size 

~ymin (float, default: -100.0)

    * Initial map size 

~xmax (float, default: 100.0)

    * Initial map size 

~ymax (float, default: 100.0)

    * Initial map size 

~delta (float, default: 0.05)

    * Processing parameters (resolution of the map) 

~llsamplerange (float, default: 0.01)

    * Translational sampling range for the likelihood 

~llsamplestep (float, default: 0.01)

    * Translational sampling range for the likelihood 

~lasamplerange (float, default: 0.005)

    * Angular sampling range for the likelihood 

~lasamplestep (float, default: 0.005)

    * Angular sampling step for the likelihood 

~transform_publish_period (float, default: 0.05)

    * How long (in seconds) between transform publications. 

~occ_thresh (float, default: 0.25)

    * Threshold on gmapping's occupancy values. Cells with greater occupancy are considered occupied (i.e., set to 100 in the resulting sensor_msgs/LaserScan). New in 1.1.0. 

~maxRange (float)

    * The maximum range of the sensor. If regions with no obstacles within the range of the sensor should appear as free space in the map, set maxUrange < maximum range of the real sensor <= maxRange. 

Required tf Transforms
<the frame attached to incoming scans> → base_link

    * usually a fixed value, broadcast periodically by a robot_state_publisher, or a tf static_transform_publisher. 

base_link → odom

    * usually provided by the odometry system (e.g., the driver for the mobile base) 

Provided tf Transforms
map → odom

    * the current estimate of the robot's pose within the map frame
